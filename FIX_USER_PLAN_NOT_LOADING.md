# 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: User Plan Not Loading from Database

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: FIXED ✅

---

## 🐛 **The Problem**

**Symptoms**:
- Admin Panel shows user with "Brand" plan ✅
- Supabase database shows user with "brand" plan ✅
- User menu (top-right) shows "Free Plan" ❌
- User doesn't get Brand plan features ❌

**Example**:
- `bitan.purkayastha@gmail.com` has `plan = 'brand'` in database
- But app shows "Free Plan" in user menu
- User can't access Brand features

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `loadUserProfile` function was **hardcoding** the plan instead of fetching it from the database:

```typescript
// ❌ OLD CODE (WRONG)
const userData: User = {
  id: authUser.id,
  email: authUser.email,
  plan: isAdmin ? 'brand' : 'free',  // ❌ HARDCODED!
  role: isAdmin ? 'admin' : 'user',
  // ...
};
```

**What this meant**:
- Any user who wasn't `bitan@outreachpro.io` was ALWAYS set to "free" plan
- Even if you changed their plan to "brand" in Supabase, it was ignored
- The app never checked the database for the actual plan

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

Changed `loadUserProfile` to **fetch the actual user profile from the database**:

```typescript
// ✅ NEW CODE (CORRECT)
const loadUserProfile = async (authUser?: any) => {
  // Fetch actual user profile from database
  const profile = await databaseService.getUserProfile(authUser.id);
  
  if (profile) {
    // Use database data ✅
    const userData = convertProfileToUser(profile);
    setUser(userData);
  } else {
    // Fallback to defaults (only for new users who don't have a profile yet)
    const userData: User = {
      id: authUser.id,
      email: authUser.email,
      plan: isAdmin ? 'brand' : 'free',
      role: isAdmin ? 'admin' : 'user',
      // ...
    };
    setUser(userData);
  }
};
```

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test 1: Refresh Browser**
1. **Logout** from the app
2. **Login again** as `bitan.purkayastha@gmail.com`
3. **Check user menu** (top-right)
4. **Expected**: Should now show "Brand Plan" ✅

### **Test 2: Plan Change Reflects Immediately**
1. **Login as admin**
2. **Open Admin Panel**
3. **Change a user's plan** (e.g., Free → Solo)
4. **Click "Save"**
5. **If you changed your own plan**:
   - User menu updates immediately ✅
   - No need to logout/login ✅

### **Test 3: Verify Features**
1. **Login as user with Brand plan**
2. **Check "Per Minute Limit"**: Should show Brand limit (not Free)
3. **Check "Daily Limit"**: Should show Brand limit (200, not 100)
4. **Try generating**: Should use Brand plan features ✅
