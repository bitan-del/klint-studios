## 🎯 What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Database Schema (Migration: `002_payment_system.sql`)

**Tables Created:**
- ✅ `subscriptions` - User subscription records
- ✅ `payments` - Payment transaction history  
- ✅ `invoices` - GST invoice records
- ✅ `invoice_counter` - Auto-incrementing invoice numbers

**Functions Created:**
- ✅ `calculate_gst(amount)` - Calculates 18% GST
- ✅ `generate_invoice_number()` - Generates sequential invoice numbers
- ✅ `check_subscription_status(user_id)` - Checks if user needs payment
- ✅ `create_subscription(...)` - Creates new subscription with payment

**RLS Policies:**
- ✅ Users can read own subscriptions/payments/invoices
- ✅ Admins can read all records

---

### ✅ TypeScript Types (`types/payment.ts`)

- PLAN_PRICING constants with GST calculations
- RazorpayOptions & RazorpayResponse
```

**Pricing (INR):**
- Free: ₹0 (3-day trial)
- Solo: ₹999 + ₹179.82 GST = **₹1,178.82**
- Studio: ₹2,999 + ₹539.82 GST = **₹3,538.82**
