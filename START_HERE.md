## 🎯 You're 3 Steps Away from Running Your App!

### Step 1: Run Database Migration (2 minutes)

**This is CRITICAL - do this first!**

1. Open your Supabase dashboard:
   👉 https://app.supabase.com/project/qayasxoiikjmkuuaphwd

2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

3. Click **"New Query"**

4. Open this file in a text editor:
   ```
   supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
   ```

5. Copy ALL the contents (all 311 lines)

6. Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor

7. Click the **Run** button (▶️)

8. You should see: ✅ "Success. No rows returned"

**This creates your entire database structure with admin auto-grant!**

---

### Step 2: Start Your App (30 seconds)

Open terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/bitanpurkayastha/Downloads/klint-studios-new
npm run dev
```

You'll see:
```
  VITE v6.4.1  ready in 500 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

---

### Step 3: Create Your Admin Account (1 minute)

1. Open your browser to: http://localhost:5173/signup.html

2. Sign up with:
   - **Email:** `bitan@outreachpro.io`
   - **Password:** Your choice (save it!)

3. Or use Google Sign-In (if you configured OAuth)

4. After signing in, you'll **automatically be admin!** 🎉

5. Look for the **shield icon** 🛡️ in the top navigation

6. Click it to open your **Admin Panel**

## 🆘 Having Issues?

### "Success. No rows returned" didn't appear?
- Make sure you copied ALL 311 lines

After signing in, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET role = 'admin', plan = 'brand'
WHERE email = 'bitan@outreachpro.io';
```
